# Home-Manager + Flake

This is my personal home-manager configuration. I've created it as a hybrid of scripts and flakes as I learn and improve my nix skills.

This was used and tested with Ubuntu 22.10.

```shell
./install.sh #Installs everything I use + nix & home-manager
```

```shell
./reload.sh #Rebuilds and switches to the home environment.
